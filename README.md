# Uber
Uber is a project developed for the Parallel and Distributed Programming exam. It consists of a set of APIs implemented with the fastapi lib in Python and follows the Actor Model design pattern.

## Fast API
For running the fastapi APIs you just have to copy and paste the folliwing command line.

```bash
# Check if "fastapi" is downloaded in your virtual environment or inside your global environment.
pip3 install fastapi

# Lib used to run fastapi command from the terminal.
pip3 install "fastapi[standard]"

fastapi dev main.py # Run in development mode, go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" to see all the APIs.
```

## Actor Model
If you want to check the documentation about the Actor Model design pattern and how it is working, you can check the python library  [The Spian](https://thespianpy.com/doc/) that we used.
